# Roadmap

1. Installation and Setup: Begin by installing the necessary dependencies like PyTorch, Transformers, FastAPI, and Uvicorn in your Python environment.

2. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather a diverse and representative dataset of local language texts, preprocess the data, and split it into training and testing sets.

3. Model Training: If the "LLAMA v2" model is a pre-trained language model with transfer learning capabilities, load the pre-trained model and fine-tune it on your local language dataset. Implement any additional improvements or changes introduced in version 2 during the training process.

4. API Server with FastAPI: Create a FastAPI app and define endpoints to serve the "LLAMA v2" model via APIs. This will enable other applications to interact with the model programmatically and get responses for language understanding tasks.

5. Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of "LLAMA v2" on the test dataset to measure its accuracy, precision, recall, or any other relevant metrics.

6. Contributing and Licensing: Encourage contributions to the project and define a suitable open-source license to govern the usage and distribution of the "LLAMA v2" model and code.
